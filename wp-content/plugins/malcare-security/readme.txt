### How does MalCare work

MalCare consists of 2 parts:

* The plugin which is installed on your WordPress site
* Our servers which work in tandem with the plugin to ensure the security of your site.

The plugin monitors the traffic to the site, such as login attempts, visits and errors. It then records this data into your WordPress database.

The MalCare servers at regular intervals contact the plugin on your site to get the status of the above data. It then collates this data, along with the data from all the other sites on our network. This is then intelligently used to prevent attacks on all the sites on our network.
